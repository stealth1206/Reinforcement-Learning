Executions of The Codes : 
-------------------------


DQN :

(a) 1) File name : Observer_1.py
    2) open terminal and run : python Observer_1.py
    3) Give the enviorment name whose observations you want to see

(b) For MountainCar-v0 :

    1) File name : mountaincar.py
    2) open terminal and run : python mountaincar.py
    3) It would take roughly around 4-5 hours to train and needs around 1000 episodes.

    For Pong-v0 :
 
    1) File name : pong.py
    2) open termional and run python pong.py
    3) It would take a huge amount of time to run. I was only run it to 10000 episodes roughly and till then it wasn't trained properly.

(c) *Grpah of comparison is attached in report.

(d) 1) File name : mcar_ddqn.py
    2) open terminal and run : python 2.py
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Policy Gradient :

(a) 1) File name : Observer_2.py
    2) open terminal and run : python Observer_2.py
    3) Give the enviorment name whose observations you want to see

(b) 1) File name : policy.py
    2) open terminal and run : python policy.py
    3) On executing five variables will be asked :
	i) Enviorment : Enter your choice of enviorment either CartPole-v0 or LunarLander-v2
       ii) Iterations : How many iterations you need to perform.CartPole trains in around 1000-2000.Lunar Lander takes lot of around 10000 iterations.
      iii) Discount Factor : i.e Gamma between 0 and 1
       iv) Batch Size : Size of batches which train together
	v) Experiment type : Press   rtg : rewards-to-go
				     dsa : advantage-normalisation
				     r   : simple rewards

(c) *Graph of comparison is attached in report.
