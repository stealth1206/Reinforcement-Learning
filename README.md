# Reinforcement-Learning

This project predominantly involves implementing the Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithm and policy gradient (PG) algorithm and testing the implementation on several Open AI Gym enviornments.
1) Implementing DQN algorithm and one of its variant, namely, DDQN by considering two environments from Open AI Gym, namely, MountainCar-v0 and Pong-v0.
2) Implementing policy gradient algorithm with variance reduction techniques and advantage Normalisation.
